# Transition-role-of-entangled-data-in-QML
This repository provides the related code for the numerical simulations in the paper "Transition role of entangled data in quantum machine learning". Please refer to our manuscript on Arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03481) for more simulation details.

All the implementations of data construction and parameterized quantum circuits training are in the file Finite_Shot_NFL.py
